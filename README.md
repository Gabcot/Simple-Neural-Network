# Single layer neural network in Python

## REQUIREMENTS
Python 2.7 or higher

## EXECUTION
In a terminal, execute command `python slnn.py`

## RESULT
 1. The program displays 3 randomly seeded weights.
 2. Trains for 10 000 iterations
 3. Redisplays the newly trained weights
 4. Makes a prediction on a new, unseen input.
 
* Since this is a seeded program, the result of the pseudo-random will always be the same
